# This sample shows how to execute a sdbx workflow, saving an image file to the location you specify.
# It does not require the server to be run. It runs sdbx embedded, as a library. No process is started.
#
# This script does not need to run within a sdbx directory. Instead, this can be used inside your own
# Python application or located elsewhere. It should **not** be in the Git repository directory.
#
# First, you will need to install sdbx. Follow the **Manual Install (Windows, Linux, macOS)** instructions in the
# README.md. If you are an experienced developer, instead run `pip install git+https://github.com/darkshapes/sdbx.git`
#
# Now you should develop your workflow. Start sdbx as normal; navigate to "Settings" in the menu, and check "Enable
# Dev mode Options". Then click "Save (API Format)". Copy and paste the contents of this file here:

# Observe this is an ordinary dictionary. The JSON that was saved from the workflow is compatible with Python syntax.
#
# Now, QUIT AND CLOSE YOUR COMFYUI SERVER. You don't need it anymore. This script will handle starting and stopping
# the server for you. Actually, it will create an object that does the same thing that pressing Queue Prompt does.
#
# We'll now write the entrypoint of our script. This is an `async def main()` because async helps us start and stop the
# code object that will run your workflow, just like pressing the Queue Prompt button.

    # You should **not** be running the sdbx application (the thing you start with /main.py). You don't need it. You
    # are not making any HTTP requests, you are not running a server, you are not connecting to anything, you are not
    # executing the main.py from the sdbx git repository, you don't even need that Git repository located anywhere.

        # Now the outputs will contain the same thing that the Web UI expresses: a file path for each output.
        # Let's find the node ID of the first SaveImage node. This will work when you change your workflow JSON from
        # the example above.

        print(outputs[save_image_node_id]["images"][0]["abs_path"])
    # At this point, all the models have been unloaded from VRAM, and everything has been cleaned up.


# Now let's make this script runnable:
import asyncio

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Since our main function is async, it must be run as async too.
    asyncio.run(main())
